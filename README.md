# Ruby Photography

## Overview

This is a website about my photography portfolio which was programmed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the timetspan of about two weeks. 
It features of a startpage as well as four other pages where you can see my portfolio, learn more about me, find out what gear to use and what gear I use and also get in contact with me. 

## Showcase

On the homepage, you'll be greeted by a scroll animation programmed in JavaScript. Unfortunately, this animation only works on desktop since JavaScript handles scrolls from a mouse and a touchscreen differently. You can get a small peek into my work on this page, but if you want to see more pictures, you can navigate via the navbar to the portfolio, where I showcase more images. From the navbar, you can also navigate to other pages such as Contact, About, or Gear. With the icon in the top right corner, you can switch the language between English and German, with English as the default language, which it was designed for.
